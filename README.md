# E-Commerce Website
Developed an E-Commerce Website where users can put several items in their cart and once they have the required items in their cart, they can place order for them. Upon placing the order, bill is generated which can be downloaded as a pdf file. There is a separate page for admin to view the orders and set their status to paid, delivered, and pending, etc.

Frontend has been developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery.
Firebase has been used which provides Backend as a Service, particularly Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database services have been used.
JsPdf library has been used to generate pdf for bills.
